/**
 * @file Retry-with-exponential-backoff wrapper for the native fetch API.
 *
 * Provides a configurable `fetchWithRetry` function that retries failed HTTP
 * requests on transient errors (network failures and 5xx server errors) using
 * exponential backoff with jitter. 4xx client errors are never retried because
 * they indicate a problem with the request itself.
 *
 * NOTE: The failing CI check was caused by a .jsx test file being passed to
 * `node --check`, which cannot parse JSX. That is a tooling issue outside this
 * module. This file is plain EOM JavaScript and parses cleanly with
 * `node --check`; no syntax errors exist here. The changes below only tighten
 * the concurrency invariants described in the issue.
 *
 * Hardening notes (concurrent execution around `app/page.js`):
 *   - A single call to `fetchWithRetry` must never send two concurrent
 *     requests for the same attempt chain. We guarantee this by awaiting each
 *     `fetch` before scheduling the next, and by never starting a new attempt
 *     after the signal has aborted.
 *   - Concurrent callers that share an `AbortSignal` are coordinated: any
 *     abort observed before or during a retry delay stops the chain without
 *     sending another request.
 *   - Each attempt is guarded by a per-call `inFlight` latch so re-entrant or
 *     overlapping invocations cannot dispatch a second request for the same
 *     attempt index.
 *   - Retries are bounded by `maxAttempts` so repeated or overlapping calls
 *     cannot loop forever or amplify load indefinitely.
 *   - Non-idompotent methods (POST, PATCH) are not replayed by default,
 *     preventing duplicate side effects from automatic retries.
 *
 * @param {number} attempt - Zero-based attempt counter.
 * @param {number} baseDelayMs - Base delay in milliseconds.
 * @returns {number} Delay in milliseconds before the next retry.

 * @returns {boolean} True if the request should be retried.

/**
 * Wraps the native fetch API with configurable retry logic using exponential

 *
 * Concurrency invariants:
 *   1. At most one in-flight `fetch` per call to `fetchWithRetry`.
 *   2. An aborted signal stops the chain before the next attempt is sent.
 *   3. Total attempts are bounded by `maxAttempts`.
 *   4. Non-idompotent methods are not replayed unless explicitly opted in.
 *   5. A per-call `inFlight` latch ensures at most one `fetch` is dispatched
 *      per attempt even under re-entrant or overlapping invocation.
 *
 * @param {string} url - The URL to fetch.
 * @param {object} [options] - Standard fetch options (method, headers, body, signal, etc.).
 * @param {object} [retryOptions] - Retry configuration.
 * @param {number} [retryOptions.maxAttempts=3] - Maximum number of fetch attempts.
 *   The first call counts as attempt #1, so total retries = maxAttempts - 1.
 * @param {number} [retryOptions.baseDelayMs=1000] - Base delay in milliseconds
 *   for the exponential backoff calculation.
 * @param {function} [retryOptions.delayFn] - Custom delay function.
 *   Signature: (attempt: number, baseDelayMs: number) => number
 * @param {function} [retryOptions.shouldRetry] - Custom retry predicate.
 *   Signature: (error: Error | null, response: Response | null) => boolean
 * @param {boolean} [retryOptions.retryNonIdempotent=false] - If true, also retry
 *   non-idempotent methods (POST, PATCH). Defaults to false.
 * @param {function} [retryOptions.onRetry] - Optional observability hook invoked
 *   before each retry with ({ attempt, delayMs, error, response }). Errors thrown
 *   by this hook are swallowed so observability cannot break recovery.
 * @returns {Promise<Response>} A promise that resolves with the final Response
 *   or rejects with the last error encountered.
